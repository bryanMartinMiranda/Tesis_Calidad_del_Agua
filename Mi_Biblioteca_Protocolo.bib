	abstract = {Over recent years, waters in and around Fiji has increasingly succumbed to a reasonable level of contamination. Water quality is deﬁned with set of standards that clearly state the parameters of diﬀerent properties in water. These standards are diﬀerent at various geographic locations. The speciﬁc quantitative values of these parameters for the Fiji Islands are established by the Fiji National Drinking Water Quality Standards (FNDWQS). Fiji is geographically located in the vast Paciﬁc Ocean, and requires a data collection framework for diﬀerent water parameters to monitor water quality. The GIS framework system can eﬀectively solve this continuously in real-time. With the end goal being to quantify diﬀerent parameters; four (04) key performance indicators (KPI) are identiﬁed: Temperature, potential of hydrogen (pH), Oxidation Reduction Potential (ORP), and Conductivity. This paper presents a Smart Water Quality Monitoring System (SWQMS) which has been developed and deployed in ﬁve (05) Fijian locations (nodes) for the aforementioned KPIs measurement. The SWQMS interfaced with GIS and were powered using solar based Renewable Energy Source (REs). Finally, obtained data were tested and analyzed using statistical methods and veriﬁed comparing with the FNDWQS. The ﬁndings demonstrated that the system is capable of delivering an accurate and consistent measurement of water quality in real-time. Hence SWQMS could be a smart choice for various Paciﬁc Island Countries (PICs) to use to monitor the water quality and in turn develop sustainable cities and societies.},

	abstract = {Energy recovery from nitrogen via nitrous oxide by applying e.g., the Coupled Aerobic-anoxic Nitrous Decomposition Operation (CANDO), is a potential key to more sustainable and energy-eﬃcient wastewater treatment facilities. In this study, laboratory-scale investigations were conducted for the second stage of a continuously operated CANDO process over 84 cycles to test and validate the oxidation reduction potential (ORP) as operational control variable. The ORP was investigated to optimize eﬄuent nitrite (NO2−) concentrations, nitrous oxide (N2O) yields and overall process conditions under real feed-stream conditions. Characteristic deviations for stable operational conditions, underload and overload could be derived based on representative cycles. The results revealed that continuously increasing ORP deviations are correlated to the abundance of nitrite in anoxic reaction periods and that the depletion of nitrite and nitrous oxide correlates with switching from a positive to negative ORP gradient. These observations were supported by investigating the dynamics of relevant process parameters of a single cycle. Ultimately, the reactor was successfully operated under dynamic conditions i.e., diﬀerent chemical oxygen demand to nitrite ratios (COD/N) ratios, and automatically controlled by applying an ORP gradient of −1 mV/min over 20 min as termination criterion for anoxic reaction periods. This operation resulted in stable and reliable NO2− elimination. Additionally, previous observations concerning the necessity of a COD/N ratio of 4 could be conﬁrmed concerning optimal N2O yields. A COD/N ratio of 5 compromised the N2O yield to a higher nitrogen removal rate.},

The main novelty of this study was to build a coupled CNN–LSTM model to predict water quality variables.

Time series of the physicochemical water quality variables, speciﬁcally pH, oxidation–reduction potential (ORP; mV), water temperature (°C), electrical conductivity (EC; lS/cm), DO and Chl-a, were obtained using a sensor at 15-min intervals from June 1, 2012 to May 31, 2013 for model development. Lag times of up to one (t - 1) and two (t - 2) for input variables pH, ORP, water temperature, and EC were used to predict DO and Chl-a concentrations, respectively. Each model’s performance in both training and testing phases was assessed using statistical metrics including the correlation coefﬁcient (r), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), their normalized equivalents (RRMSE, RMAE; \%), percentage of bias (PBIAS), Nash–Sutcliffe coefﬁcient (ENS), Willmott’s Index, and graphical plots (Taylor diagram, box plot and spider diagram). Results showed that LSTM outperformed the CNN model for DO prediction, but the standalone DL models yielded similar performances for Chl-a prediction. Generally, the hybrid CNN–LSTM models outperformed the standalone models (LSTM, CNN, SVR and DT models) in predicting both DO and Chl-a.

According to the results obtained, the presence of fecal and total coliforms occurred with average values of oxide-reduction potential (ORP) of 250 mV, and the absence of these was presented with an average ORP of 760 mV. The research work showed that there is a relation of presence absence of fecal and total coliforms with respect to the potential of oxide reduction, so it is possible to use this parameter to determine the presence or absence of coliforms in water in a water treatment plant. According to the statistical analysis performed for the data obtained from coliforms in the filtration unit, it was obtained that there is no direct correlation between the ORP and fecal and total coliforms, given that the Pearson coefficients found were -0.203, -0.388 with a significance of 0.549 and 0.239 respectively, which shows that there is no statistically significant relationship between these variables. For ORP values below 300 mV, there is no linear behavior that allows to establish the ratio of fecal and total coliforms with the oxide-reduction potential.},

Measurements of oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) in water reflect the tendency of major constituents in the water to accept or lose electrons. Although ORP measurements are valuable and can provide useful information toward protecting public health, they are not widely undertaken by the drinking water community for a variety of reasons. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of five oxidants commonly used in drinking water treatment as well as the effect of pH on measured ORP. Results showed that the ORP of each oxidant system increased with increasing oxidant concentration to a maximum. The ORP also decreased with increasing pH. Water treated with chlorine and chlorine dioxide had the greatest ORP followed by water containing monochloramine and permanganate and water containing only oxygen. Duplicate ORP measurements revealed some inconsistencies with redox electrode measurements.},

This results in the variation of the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) of the afﬂuent. Hence, the current study is aimed at the application of ORP as a real-time tool to monitor brewery wastewater quality. Other physicochemical parameters of the local brewery in South Africa investigated included temperature (T), pH, conductivity, turbidity, total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD), soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD), particulate chemical oxygen demand (PCOD), total solids, orthophosphate, ammoniacal nitrogen, total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate, and nitrite nitrogen. It was found that the ORP decreased (135 to −305 mV) with an increase in alkalinity (pH 4.4 to 12.2) with linear regression coefﬁcient ﬁt (R2 = 0.9994). The ORP facilitated the wastewater nutrient constituent degradability which improved the water quality. Furthermore, the high organic content of the brewery wastewater was found as measured by total COD (3447–11,813 mg/L). This suggests remediation before reuse of the brewery wastewater will require a robust integrated wastewater treatment process.},

	abstract = {With the globally increasing electricity demand, its related uncertainties are on the rise as well. Therefore, a deeper insight of load forecasting techniques for projecting future electricity demands becomes imperative for business entities and policy makers. The electricity demand is governed by a set of diﬀerent variables or “electricity demand determinants”. These demand determinants depend on forecasting horizons (long term, medium term, and short term), the load aggregation level, climate, and socio-economic activities. In this paper, a review of diﬀerent electricity demand forecasting methodologies is provided in the context of a group of low and middle income countries. The article presents a comprehensive literature review by tabulating the diﬀerent demand determinants used in diﬀerent countries and forecasting the trends and techniques used in these countries. A comparative review of these forecasting methodologies over diﬀerent time horizons reveals that the time series modeling approach has been extensively used while forecasting for long and medium terms. For short term forecasts, artiﬁcial intelligence-based techniques remain prevalent in the literature. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the demand determinants in these countries indicates a frequent use of determinants like the population, GDP, weather, and load data over diﬀerent time horizons. Following the analysis, potential research gaps are identiﬁed, and recommendations are provided, accordingly.},

The changes of ORP values by this rapid method were found clearly distinguishing between oxidized and fresh rock type.},

	abstract = {Domestic wastewater consists of considerable concentrations of pollutants that can boost water eutrophication if not treated before final discharge, which could damage the ecosystem and negatively affect human health. Sequencing batch reactor (SBR) technology is considered a promising biological wastewater treatment technology to address these issues. In recent years, SBR selection has increased as an effective technology for the treatment of domestic and industrial wastewaters due to its setup simplicity and ease of operation. However, many researchers have reported differences in cycle time. The importance and originality of this study is that it explores the parameters of pH, temperature, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and dissolved oxygen (DO) throughout the SBR cycle to predict the end of the treatment cycle. A laboratory-scale SBR was used in this study with a five-litre working volume. It was equipped with four electronic sensors (probes) to monitor the pH, ORP, temperature and DO. The SBR was operated under constant aeration, 1.0 l/min, ±12 Cº temperature and 6 h cycle time. Each cycle of the SBR operation included Fill (30 minutes), React (240 minutes), Settle (30 minutes), Draw (30 minutes) and Idle (30 minutes). Influent and effluent samples were analysed for COD, ammonia-N and nitrate-N. The pH, ORP and DO values at the end of the 6 h HRT treatment cycle were between 6.6-7.9, 147-169 mV and 4.6-6.6 mg/l respectively. The results show complete degradation of COD and nitrogen compounds was seen when the DO profile increased due to bacterial respiration. The results prove that online monitoring of SBR operating parameters could significantly predict the end of the treatment cycle, and the pH, DO and ORP profiles could be used as onsite process control parameters.},

	volume = {15},
	abstract = {The degrading drinking-water quality in Najaf, Iraq, requires immediate attention. This paper present an electronic water-monitoring system capable of facilitating proactive response to curb unsafe water supply in Najaf. The proposed system is intended to replace the conventional method, which is time-consuming and fails at real-time data generation. The proposed system is affordable and based on a wireless sensor network (WSN) and internet of things (IoT) to perform real-time monitoring and issue timely warning SMSs and e-mails. In this study statistical analysis was performed on data collected from five different water stations within Najaf. To demonstrate implementation of the proposed system, a user-specific website that highlights the water-purification process has been developed. The system affords remote- and smart-monitoring capabilities to determine water pH level; temperature; nitrate, chloride, and dissolved oxygen concentration; turbidity; oxidation-reduction potential (ORP); conductivity or total dissolved solids (TDS) and sodium content. Findings of this study indicate that drinking-water quality in Najaf is poor, and that the current waterpurification system is unable to maintain prescribed water-quality standards. Results from five stations demonstrate that measured levels of water-quality parameters are well below those prescribed by the World Health Organization. Use of the proposed water-quality monitoring system serves to enhance drinkingwater quality significantly.},
